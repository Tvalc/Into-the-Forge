## 6. The Story of Solis

### The Frozen World
In the depths of space, the planet Solis spins in eternal winter. Once a world of warmth and life, it now lies frozen beneath sheets of ice and snow. The only source of life is the SolForge, a massive tower that pierces the clouds, its arcane sun casting a pale light across the frozen landscape.

But the SolForge is more than just a beacon of life—it is a prison. Deep within its core lies Vossuun, the Root Wyrm, an ancient entity of darkness and hunger. The tower was built to contain this being, but its influence has begun to seep into the world, corrupting the very magic that sustains life.

### The Factions
Four distinct peoples have adapted to survive in this frozen world. The Tempys, elemental nomads who embrace the harsh conditions, roam the tundra in search of strength and honor. The Alloyin, masters of technology and magic, have built their gleaming city of Brightsteel near the SolForge. The Uterra, stewards of nature, have created a lush underground realm where life still thrives. And the Nekrium, once rulers of death, have fallen to the darkness, their kingdom of the undead now a bastion of corruption.

Each faction has produced Forgeborn—legendary warriors who can channel the power of the SolForge itself. These champions are the last hope of their people, and the only ones who might stand against the growing darkness. All except the Nekrium's Forgeborn, who have been corrupted by Vossuun's influence, turning their mastery of death into a tool of the ancient entity.

### The Disappearance
It began with Korok's disappearance. The Khan of Kadras, master of fire and stone, vanished without a trace. The Tempys tribes, already fracturing under the strain of the eternal winter, began to turn on each other. Without their leader, the elemental nomads lost their way.

But Korok's absence was only the beginning. The Nekrium, long corrupted by Vossuun's influence, began their assault on the other factions. Their undead legions marched across Solis, spreading the darkness that had consumed their kingdom. The machines of Brightsteel turned against their masters as the Nekrium's death magic corrupted their circuits. The plants of the Rootrealms grew twisted and wild under the influence of the undead. The SolForge's corruption was spreading, and the Nekrium were its willing servants.

### The Darkforged
The first Darkforged appeared in the frozen wastes—corrupted versions of Forgeborn, their powers twisted by Vossuun's influence. Many were once Nekrium champions, their mastery of death perverted into a tool of destruction. They spread across Solis, turning the factions against each other, feeding on the chaos and conflict. The world was falling apart, and the true threat remained hidden beneath the SolForge, with the Nekrium as its most powerful agents.

### The Journey
The remaining Forgeborn—Oros, Cercee (who had broken free from the Nekrium's corruption), Ironbeard, and the young Ignir—began to piece together the truth. Through visions, ancient texts, and the whispers of the dead, they learned of Vossuun's existence. They discovered that the SolForge was not just a source of power, but a prison for an entity that predated history itself.

One by one, they made their way to the SolForge, fighting through corrupted lands and facing their own dark reflections. They saw the truth of their world—how the eternal winter was not a natural disaster, but a consequence of Vossuun's imprisonment. How the Nekrium's corruption was spreading, turning death itself into a weapon against life.

### The Final Stand
At the heart of the SolForge, they found Korok—bound and corrupted, but not yet lost. Together, the Forgeborn faced Vossuun, the Root Wyrm, in a battle that would determine the fate of Solis. They had to choose: seal the ancient entity away again, condemning their world to eternal winter, or risk everything to destroy it and face the unknown consequences.

The choice was theirs to make, but one thing was certain—the age of the Forgeborn was ending, and a new chapter in Solis's history was about to begin. The Nekrium's corruption would be purged, and death would be restored to its natural order.

### Epilogue
Whether they chose to seal Vossuun away or destroy it, the Forgeborn's actions would change Solis forever. The factions would have to learn to work together, to see beyond their differences and embrace the unity that had saved their world. The Nekrium would need to be purified, their connection to death restored to its natural state. The eternal winter might end, or it might continue, but the people of Solis would face their future together, stronger for having overcome the darkness that had threatened to consume them all.

## The Forgeborn

### Character Backstories

#### Korok, The Last Khan (Tempys)
The aging Khan of Kadras, Korok is the last of the great Tempys warlords who once ruled the frozen wastes. Born during the last great thaw, he witnessed the gradual freezing of Solis and the fracturing of the Tempys tribes. As a young warrior, he discovered his connection to the SolForge when he saved his tribe from a massive ice storm by channeling its power through his body. This earned him the title "Forgeborn" and eventually, the leadership of the Tempys people.

Korok's wisdom and strength have kept the Tempys tribes united for decades, but his disappearance has left a power vacuum that threatens to destroy what little unity remains. His connection to the SolForge is the strongest of all the Forgeborn, making him both a target and a key to Vossuun's plans.

#### Oros, The Time Weaver (Alloyin)
Once a brilliant Alloyin scientist studying the SolForge's energy patterns, Oros discovered that the Forge's power could be used to manipulate time itself. This discovery led to his transformation into a Forgeborn, but at a cost - his body became partially crystallized, a permanent reminder of his connection to the Forge. Now the chief advisor to the Alloyin Council, Oros has been warning of the SolForge's corruption for years, but his warnings fell on deaf ears until it was too late.

Oros and Korok have been close allies for decades, with Oros often visiting the Tempys lands to study the Forge's effects on the environment. Their friendship has helped maintain peace between the Alloyin and Tempys, making Oros's current mission to find Korok deeply personal.

#### Cercee, The Root Whisperer (Uterra)
The youngest of the Uterra's Forgeborn, Cercee was once a simple gardener in the Rootrealms before discovering her ability to communicate with the ancient plants that grow near the SolForge. Her connection to nature is so strong that she can feel the corruption spreading through the world's plant life, making her one of the first to sense Vossuun's influence.

Cercee has a complicated relationship with the other Forgeborn. While she respects Korok's leadership and Oros's wisdom, she often clashes with Ironbeard over the Alloyin's use of technology. Her friendship with Ignir, however, is genuine - she sees in the young Tempys warrior the same potential for growth that she once had.

#### Ironbeard, The Forge Master (Alloyin)
A legendary Alloyin engineer who built the first mechanical enhancements powered by SolForge energy, Ironbeard's body is more machine than flesh. His experiments with the Forge's power have given him incredible strength and durability, but at the cost of his humanity. Now the head of the Alloyin's Forge Research Division, he has been studying the SolForge's corruption, though his methods often put him at odds with Oros's more cautious approach.

Ironbeard's relationship with Korok is one of mutual respect - the Khan often sought the engineer's counsel on matters of the Forge. However, his rivalry with Oros over the direction of Alloyin research has created tension within the faction. Despite this, he remains committed to finding a solution to the corruption.

#### Ignir, The Flame Child (Tempys)
The youngest and most impulsive of the Forgeborn, Ignir was born during a rare moment when the SolForge's power surged through the Tempys lands. This exposure to raw Forge energy as an infant gave him incredible speed and agility, but also made him more susceptible to the Forge's corruption. Korok took the young warrior under his wing, teaching him to control his powers and use them for the good of the Tempys people.

Ignir's relationship with the other Forgeborn is complex. He sees Korok as a father figure, looks up to Oros for his wisdom, and has formed a close bond with Cercee. However, his youth and impulsiveness often put him at odds with Ironbeard's more methodical approach. His connection to the Forge, while powerful, makes him particularly vulnerable to Vossuun's influence.

#### Voss, The Corrupted (Nekrium) [Secret Character]
Once the greatest of the Nekrium's Forgeborn, Voss was the first to discover the true nature of the SolForge's power. His experiments with death magic led him to Vossuun's influence, and he became the first to willingly embrace the corruption. However, unlike other corrupted Forgeborn, Voss maintained his free will, using the dark power to enhance his abilities while resisting complete control.

Voss's relationship with the other Forgeborn is one of manipulation and betrayal. He was once close friends with Korok, and it was he who first warned the Khan about the SolForge's corruption. However, his methods of combating the corruption - embracing it to understand it - led to his fall from grace. Now, he walks a fine line between ally and enemy, helping the other Forgeborn while pursuing his own mysterious agenda.

### The Forgeborn's Role
The Forgeborn are more than just powerful warriors - they are the living embodiment of their factions' connection to the SolForge. Each one represents a different aspect of the Forge's power:
- Korok: Raw elemental force
- Oros: Temporal manipulation
- Cercee: Life and growth
- Ironbeard: Technological advancement
- Ignir: Speed and agility
- Voss: Death and corruption

Their relationships with each other reflect the complex political landscape of Solis, with alliances and rivalries that have shaped the world's history. As the corruption spreads, these relationships will be tested, and the Forgeborn will have to decide whether to stand together or fall apart.
