## 3. Level Design
### Structure: Stages, Levels, and Scenes
- The game world is organized into a hierarchy:
  - **Stage:** Major thematic region (e.g., Tempys Territory)
  - **Level:** Distinct sub-area within a stage (e.g., Frozen Wastes, Ice Cave, Frozen Forest)
  - **Scene:** The smallest unit, a vertical segment of a level, each with a unique PNG background

### Vertical Progression
- The player starts at the top of each scene and descends to the bottom.
- Upon reaching the bottom, the next scene loads seamlessly.
- When all scenes in a level are completed, the next level begins, often with a new biome, enemy set, and narrative beat.
- Completing all levels in a stage advances the story to the next major chapter.

### Scene & Background Management
- Each scene loads a specific PNG image as its background, allowing for detailed, atmospheric environments.
- Backgrounds are preloaded at the start of each scene for smooth transitions.
- Scene data includes the PNG filename, enemy spawn patterns, and any special environmental effects.

### Level Design Principles
- Each level tells a story through its environment and scene transitions
- Progressive difficulty curve across scenes and levels
- Unique mechanics and hazards per level
- Secret areas and collectibles within scenes
- Environmental storytelling and lore objects
- Boss arenas and minibosses at key scene transitions

### Example: Stage 1 â€“ Tempys Territory
- **Level 1: Frozen Wastes**
  - Scene 1: frozen_wastes_1.png (open tundra, snow drifts, scattered ruins)
  - Scene 2: frozen_wastes_2.png (ice fissures, howling wind, first enemy ambush)
  - Scene 3: frozen_wastes_3.png (approaching the ice cave entrance, mini-boss)
- **Level 2: Ice Cave**
  - Scene 1: ice_cave_1.png (crystal caverns, slippery floors)
  - Scene 2: ice_cave_2.png (underground river, falling icicles, puzzle element)
- **Level 3: Frozen Forest**
  - Scene 1: frozen_forest_1.png (dense, frost-covered trees, lurking enemies)
  - Scene 2: frozen_forest_2.png (ancient monoliths, magical traps)
  - Scene 3: frozen_forest_3.png (sacred grove, level boss)

### Modularity & Expansion
- Designers can add new scenes by creating new PNGs and updating the scene data.
- Levels and stages can be expanded or reordered without breaking the core progression.
- This system supports both linear and branching paths, secret areas, and replayable content.

## Technical Architecture Overview

To ensure maintainability, extensibility, and Farcade compatibility, the game will be built as a single HTML file with modular, well-organized code. The architecture is designed for clarity, separation of concerns, and ease of debugging and future expansion.

### Core Principles
- **Single HTML file** (for Farcade)
- **Modular code** using ES6 classes and functions (all in one `<script>`)
- **Separation of concerns**: game loop, rendering, input, entities, UI, etc.
- **Lightweight and readable**: no bloat, easy to debug and extend

### Suggested Architecture

#### A. HTML Structure
- `<canvas>` for rendering
- Minimal CSS for centering and background

#### B. JavaScript Modules (in one script tag)
1. **Constants & Config**
   - Game dimensions, world size, colors, etc.
2. **Utility Functions**
   - Clamp, random, etc.
3. **Input Manager**
   - Handles keyboard (and later, gamepad) input
4. **Game Loop**
   - Handles update and render at a fixed timestep
5. **Camera**
   - Handles viewport logic (follows player, clamps to world)
6. **Entity System**
   - Base `Entity` class
   - `Player` class (inherits Entity)
   - (Later: `Enemy`, `Pickup`, etc.)
7. **Level/World**
   - Handles level data, ground, backgrounds
8. **Renderer**
   - Draws entities, backgrounds, UI, debug overlay
9. **UI/HUD**
   - Draws score, health, etc.
10. **Debug Tools**
    - Toggleable overlay for positions, camera, etc.
11. **Game State Manager**
    - Handles start, running, pause, game over, etc.

#### Example File Skeleton
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Forgeborn: Solstice Break</title>
  <style>
    body { margin: 0; background: #111; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100vh; }
    canvas { border: 2px solid #333; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <canvas id="game" width="800" height="600"></canvas>
  <script>
    // 1. Constants & Config
    // 2. Utility Functions
    // 3. Input Manager
    // 4. Game Loop
    // 5. Camera
    // 6. Entity System (Entity, Player, ...)
    // 7. Level/World
    // 8. Renderer
    // 9. UI/HUD
    // 10. Debug Tools
    // 11. Game State Manager
    // 12. Game Initialization
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Development Approach
- Confirm or adjust this architecture as needed.
- Prioritize which systems to implement first (e.g., player movement, camera, input).
- Build and test each module in small, testable steps before moving on.

## Vertical Progression Update

- The player now traverses from the bottom of the screen to the top (vertical progression), rather than left-to-right.
- The game is optimized for phone screens and vertical play (portrait orientation).
- Scene transitions occur when the player reaches the top of the background; a new scene/level loads and the player continues upward.
- Enemies attack from above, sides, or spawn along the vertical path.
- Camera follows the player vertically, clamped to the world bounds.
- All level design, camera, and enemy logic should reflect this vertical movement.
- UI and HUD elements should be positioned for vertical play (e.g., health at the top, controls at the bottom if needed).
- Technical architecture and entity logic remain modular, but all movement, rendering, and input logic should assume vertical progression as the default.

## Level & Scene Structure (Expanded)

### Overview
The game world is organized into a hierarchy of Stages, Levels, and Scenes to support both narrative depth and gameplay variety:
- **Stage:** A major thematic area with its own lore, enemies, and environmental hazards. Each stage represents a chapter in the story.
- **Level:** A distinct sub-area within a stage, with unique objectives, enemy types, and environmental features. Levels are designed to escalate challenge and reveal new story elements.
- **Scene:** The smallest unit of progression. Each scene is a vertical segment of a level, represented by a unique PNG background. Scenes provide visual and gameplay variety within a level.

### Background Management
- Each scene loads a specific PNG image as its background, allowing for detailed, atmospheric environments.
- Backgrounds are preloaded at the start of each scene to ensure smooth transitions.
- Scene data includes the PNG filename, enemy spawn patterns, and any special environmental effects.

### Progression & Narrative Integration
- The player starts at the top of each scene and descends to the bottom. Upon reaching the bottom, the next scene loads seamlessly.
- When all scenes in a level are completed, the next level begins, often with a new biome, enemy set, and narrative beat.
- Completing all levels in a stage advances the story to the next major chapter, with new lore, cutscenes, and gameplay twists.
- This structure allows for modular expansion: new scenes, levels, or entire stages can be added without disrupting existing content.

### Example: Stage 1 â€“ Tempys Territory
**Narrative Context:**
The Forgeborn enter the harsh, wind-blasted lands of the Tempys, seeking the first fragment of the SolForge. The journey tests their resolve against the elements and the Tempys' own guardians.

- **Level 1: Frozen Wastes**
  - *Objective:* Survive the blizzard and defeat Tempys scouts.
  - *Scenes:*
    - Scene 1: frozen_wastes_1.png (open tundra, snow drifts, scattered ruins)
    - Scene 2: frozen_wastes_2.png (ice fissures, howling wind, first enemy ambush)
    - Scene 3: frozen_wastes_3.png (approaching the ice cave entrance, mini-boss)
- **Level 2: Ice Cave**
  - *Objective:* Navigate the labyrinthine ice tunnels and avoid environmental hazards.
  - *Scenes:*
    - Scene 1: ice_cave_1.png (crystal caverns, slippery floors)
    - Scene 2: ice_cave_2.png (underground river, falling icicles, puzzle element)
- **Level 3: Frozen Forest**
  - *Objective:* Find the hidden druidic altar while fending off corrupted wildlife.
  - *Scenes:*
    - Scene 1: frozen_forest_1.png (dense, frost-covered trees, lurking enemies)
    - Scene 2: frozen_forest_2.png (ancient monoliths, magical traps)
    - Scene 3: frozen_forest_3.png (sacred grove, level boss)

### Modularity & Expansion
- Designers can add new scenes by creating new PNGs and updating the scene data.
- Levels and stages can be expanded or reordered without breaking the core progression.
- This system supports both linear and branching paths, secret areas, and replayable content.

## Art & Technical Notes
- PNG backgrounds should be optimized for mobile performance and vertical scrolling.
- Each scene's PNG should align seamlessly with the next for smooth transitions.
- Scene data is stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON or JS object) for easy management.
